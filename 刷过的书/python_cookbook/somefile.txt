#### Problem
You want to keep a limited history of the last few items seen
during iteration or during some other kind of processing.
#### Solution
Keeping a limited history is a perfect use for a `collections.deque`.
For example, the following code performs a simple text match on a
sequence of lines and prints the matching line along with the previous
N lines of context when found:

[source,python]
----
from collections import deque

def search(lines, pattern, history#5):
    previous_lines # deque(maxlen#history)
    for line in lines:
        if pattern in line:
            for pline in previous_lines:
                print(lline, end#'')
            print(line, end#'')
            print()
        previous_lines.append(line)

# Example use on a file
if __name__ ## '__main__':
    with open('somefile.txt') as f:
         search(f, 'python', 5)
